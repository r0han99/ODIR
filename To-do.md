### To do  
- [x] The class columns and the target-labels mentioned in the dataframe are unreliable, so we need to re-create them from the actual columns itself.

- [x] Re-engineering the paths to fit the current file structure.

- [x] A pipeline script which takes a particular patient_id and prints a subplot of both left_right fundus with their diagnosis as the title.

- [ ] Engineer Left and Right Diagnostic Keywords to fill up the missing pairs with their Diagnosis

  - Upon completetion. Improve the above pipeline to display, Diagnosis of both Left and Right Eye as the ``plt.suptitle()``
